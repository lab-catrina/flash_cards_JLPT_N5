Flash cards to help with learning vocabulary for JLPT N5

Here's a simple GUI with flash cards for studying vocabulary for JLPT N5.
The N5 corpus was taken from https://github.com/jamsinclair/open-anki-jlpt-decks/tree/master/src

The flash card shows a randomly selected Japanese word (first line - word with kanji, if applicable, second line - the reading). The flash card automatically flips after 4s to reveal the English translation. Clicking the check mark button will remove the learned word from the pool for the current session, so it won't be shown anymore, unless the program is restarted. Clicking on the cross mark will keep the card in the pool, so it can be shown again.
